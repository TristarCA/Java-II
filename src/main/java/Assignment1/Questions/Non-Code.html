1. When the handler "catch (Exception e)" is used in Java any exceptions that occur are caught. This is however
a bad practice as using this to catch exceptions makes it more difficult to see what the exception may is.

2. This code has an issue in that it will not compile due to the two exceptions that are attempting to be caught.
Since the first catch is a "catchall" with the "catch (Exception e)" The next exception is not needed and will
never actually occur. Java will refuse to let this code compile due to this error

9. To enable assertions in Java you have to click on "Current File" and select "Edit Configurations..." Select the file
you want to allow assertions for, open the drop down menu "Modify options", select "Add VM Options" and type -ea under
the VM options.
