16.4 The reason adding additional element to an ArrayList whose current size is less than capacity is a relatively fast operation
in contrast to the same operation being done to an ArrayList that is already at capacity is due to how the growth of the ArrayList is handled.
In an ArrayList that is not yet at capacity the ArrayList does not need to grow as it has already allocated memory sufficient enough for the
new information. In an at capacity ArrayList however the additional information will cause it to grow which results in it creating
a new, larger internal array and copying each of its element to the new array.

    1 The primary difference between a set and a map is that Maps contain key and value pairs whereas Sets only contain values.
      In a Map the keys must be unique while the values do not need to be unique, in a Set the values must all be unique

    2 When you add a primitive type to a collection it will be converted from a primitive value into an object of the
      corresponding type-wrapper class.

    3 Yes, but it would be very inefficient as you would need to type out each individual call to print the elements.
      System.out.println(FirstElement);
      System.out.println(SecondElement);
      System.out.println(ThirdElement);
      etc.....
